# Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection

This project implements an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection in a synthetic data stream. The Isolation Forest algorithm is an ensemble method based on the concept of isolation, which is effective in identifying outliers in datasets.

## Features

- Generates synthetic data with seasonal patterns and anomalies.
- Implements Isolation Tree and Isolation Forest classes to fit the model and compute anomaly scores.
- Visualizes the data stream with detected anomalies highlighted.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the following Python packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
